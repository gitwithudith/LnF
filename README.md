## Campus Lost and Found
This is a website made using Python and Flask.
When a student loses their stuff in the campus, they generally post it in WhatsApp Groups / Search in the Lost and Found Office.
There is no specific intimation and communication system for students where they can notify each other about lost items and as well when someone else finds the lost item and can directly communicate with the owner and return to them.

The website "Lost and Found" basically aims to solve that problem.
In this Website, one can post all the details about the lost item, such as Name, Description, Picture, Date lost and also Owner's Details like Name, Phone Number, and also contains a specific option to contact the owner.
Items lost are also sorted into different categories such as Electronics, Bags, Clothing, Accessories, Electronics and more so that the process of sorting and browsing items becomes easier.
This webiste also has Login and Sign Up features, although these features are still in development stage.
